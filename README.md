The script is a financial calculator that allows the user to choose between two options: "investment" or "bond".

If the user chooses "investment", the script prompts them to enter information about their investment, such as the amount of money they plan to deposit and the interest rate. 
Then it calculates the amount of interest earned using either simple or compound interest method.

If the user chooses "bond", it creates a home loan repayment calculator that calculates the monthly payments for the bond repayment and prints the result.

If the user enters an invalid choice, the script displays an error message. It also uses math library which is used for mathematical calculations in this script.
